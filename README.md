[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## React UI - Component Library
Because of the hundreds of code lines on every project i am creating a component based ui to reduce both the size and the complexity of an `App`.

### `Stack`
+ I'm using `styled components` to stylize the components
+ `Typescript` to type safe while you are consuming this UI and helping you in the building process.
+ `Testing` with `@testing-library/react` only to address the project.
